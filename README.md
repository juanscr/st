# st
In this project my own build for the suckless terminal can be found. This build
does only what I think works for me and my workflow. Furthermore, there aren't
any major differences to the stantard st build as a minimum amount of patches
have been done to preserve simplicity.

This build has:
- An alpha value that determines the transparency of the background of the
terminal.
- Scrollback using keys and mouse is added. For mouse scrolling, use the shift
  key while moving the mouse wheel.
- A vim-like keys, to facilitate easy movement through the terminal and text.
- A dracula color scheme.

Build based on __st 0.8.4__.
